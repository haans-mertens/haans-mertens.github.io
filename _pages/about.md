Welcome to the main website for the paper "The Internet Never Forgets: A Four-Step Scraping Tutorial, Codebase, and Database for Longitudinal Organizational Website Data", by Richard F.J. Haans and Marc J. Mertens in *Organizational Research Methods*. The full paper can be accessed [here](https://haans-mertens.github.io). 

This website consists of two main parts: our [codebase](https://haans-mertens.github.io/code), which offers a general-purpose Python setup to scraping historical websites using the Wayback Machine, and our open-access CompuCrawl [database](https://haans-mertens.github.io/data), which was built using the four-step approach described in the paper. This database contains websites of North American firms in the Compustat database between 1996 and 2020â€”covering 11,277 firms with 86,303 firm/year observations and 1,617,675 webpages. 

For frequently asked questions about the code- and database, please refer to our [FAQ](https://haans-mertens.github.io/faq).
